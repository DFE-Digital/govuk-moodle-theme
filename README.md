# GOV.UK Moodle Theme
A GOV.UK Moodle theme implementing [GOV GDS](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)

# Setup
To use this theme you need to copy the the `gov-uk` directory into your moodle sites theme folder `\my-moodle-site\public\theme`. Moodle will then detect the added theme when started. You will need to confirm the installation. Once installed you will be able to select the `GOV.UK` theme from the theme selection page.

# Releases
The release.yml GitHub workflow should be used to create a release. It is designed to be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI and takes the version number as input, with the suggested format of "[major].[minor].[patch]". 
The workflow tags the latest commit on the main branch, archives the contents of the govuk folder, and creates a release which includes the created archive alongside the assets generated by default with a release. Release notes are auto-generated.
